                    and freedom fighter who is easily recognizable by his Guy

                    topple a totalitarian government of a dystopian United

                        He is at one point an inmate at "Larkhill Resettlement
                        Camp"â€”one of many concentration camps where black
                        people, Jews, leftists, beatniks, homosexuals and Ethnic
                        Irish are exterminated by Norsefire, a fascist
                        dictatorship that rules Britain. On a stormy night
                        (namely, December 23 in the novel or November 5 in the
                        film), he detonates his homemade bomb and escapes his
                        cell.

                    <li>
                        Four years after his escape from Larkhill, V blows up
                        the Old Bailey statue on November 5, Guy Fawkes Day.

                        V stages an attack on the government's propaganda

                        and forcing the staff to follow his orders under threat
                        of detonating them. V then broadcasts a message to the
                        people, telling them to take responsibility for
                        themselves and rise up against their government.
